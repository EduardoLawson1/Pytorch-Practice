### Section 1: PyTorch Fundamentals

This section introduces PyTorch from the ground up, making it accessible even for those just starting. Begining by covering PyTorch’s core data structure: the tensor, essential for data representation in machine learning. Learning to create and manipulate tensors is a foundational skill for anyone working with machine learning models in PyTorch. Through hands-on examples, you’ll gain a deep understanding of the tensor datatype, setting a strong base for the advanced concepts explored in later sections.
