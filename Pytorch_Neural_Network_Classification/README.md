### Section 3: PyTorch Neural Network Classification

Classification is one of the most widely used approaches in machine learning, answering questions like, "Is this one thing or another?" In real-world examples, this could mean determining whether an email is spam or not, or whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent. In this section, youâ€™ll learn to build a neural network for classification using PyTorch, equipping you to create models that classify data based on learned patterns. By the end, you'll have the skills to tackle classification tasks and make informed predictions.
