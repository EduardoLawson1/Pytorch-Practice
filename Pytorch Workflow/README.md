### Section 2: PyTorch Workflow

Now that you’ve grasped the fundamentals and learned how to create tensors to represent data, it’s time to move to the next stage: putting it all together in a PyTorch workflow. In this section, you’ll learn the essential steps to progress from raw data to tensors to a trained neural network model. These steps form the core of PyTorch projects and will be invaluable as you explore PyTorch code both in this course and beyond. By the end of this section, you’ll have a clear understanding of the process for building and training models in PyTorch.
