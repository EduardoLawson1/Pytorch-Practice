### Section 5: PyTorch Custom Datasets

One of the most exciting aspects of machine learning is applying it to your own data. While many datasets are available, this section teaches you how to load custom datasets into PyTorch—essential for tailoring models to unique tasks. We’ll walk through setting up *FoodVision Mini*, a PyTorch model designed to classify images of foods like pizza, steak, and sushi. (Getting hungry to learn?) This foundational dataset will be used and expanded upon throughout the course, giving you hands-on experience with data loading and preprocessing for custom projects.
