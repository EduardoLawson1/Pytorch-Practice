### Section 5: PyTorch Going Modular

A key strength of PyTorch is its flexibility, enabling you to write machine learning code that’s both powerful and Pythonic. Typically, this can be done in two main ways: Jupyter/Google Colab notebooks for quick experimentation, and Python scripts for greater modularity and reproducibility. In this section, you’ll learn to transform code from your notebooks into reusable Python scripts. By structuring code in this modular way, you’ll not only make it easier to share and collaborate but also align with how PyTorch projects are often built and shared in the field.
