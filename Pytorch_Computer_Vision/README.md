### Section 4: PyTorch Computer Vision

Neural networks have revolutionized computer vision, and PyTorch is at the forefront of this transformation, powering many of today’s cutting-edge algorithms. From self-driving cars to facial recognition, PyTorch enables the development of systems that interpret and classify visual data. In this section, you’ll build a neural network in PyTorch capable of identifying patterns in images and categorizing them into distinct classes. By the end, you’ll have practical skills to create powerful image recognition models, opening up endless possibilities in computer vision.
